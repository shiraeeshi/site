Things that were confusing about i3:

- How to select a border
- Which borders were draggable, which borders were not
- That you needed to go mod-v mod-d application with the focus on the application you want to split vertically in order to get the split to happen
- How to navigate between windows w/o alt-tab (I still don't exactly know that I mostly just spam mod-j and mod-l until it works


Things that I am still confused about i3:

- What the bottom line is doing
- How to view this mystical "tree"
- How to set keyboard shortcuts
