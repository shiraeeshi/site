I was one of those people, so, things college was good at: 

- introducing me to "this is what upper level undergrad/lower level grad <subject> looks like" as a freshman, because as it turns out, there's a huge difference between the papers from academic researchers and papers from ??corporate researchers that I was looking at 
- having lots of people who have put too much time into studying the classics of the world around me 
- being near a bunch of other universities 
- having places I could wander into late at night like the college library or coffeeshop, as most normal locations close around 9-10 and sometimes that's just when I'd get started 
- being totally unaccountable if necessary on weekends (may require prep w/ campus job) so I could just have a flow of "go to show @ 10 pm Friday night, find some nearby 24 hour diners/friend's places, crash there until transit gets up and running again, come back, and die I guess the next day" which is apparently very ego-syntonic
- walk the few blocks to the library, pick up a novel i've been meaning to get to, chug through it in 6 hours, then return it on my offdays 

Things I wish I'd done differently: 
- been less abrasive with professors (I was an uppity asshole and nearly failing analysis ii really got my perspectives in gear) 
- read more "unrelated nonsense", the best things that I read were Philosophical Investigations, On the Moral Development of the Child, and What is Called Thinking? none of which are very pertinent specifically to my career, what I want my career to be, or my classes mostly, but it's also excellent
- blogged more, in terms of "huh, this is cool" (not just on tumblr because that's so hard to index + analyze, I wish I'd gotten Github Pages up earlier because it's pretty easy (if you're going to a polytech or maybe even state school, if you know CS people you can maybe ask for server space for website hosting so that you don't have to deal w/ the limitations of Pages, the *waves hands wildly* of AWS/Azure/Google App Engine/Heroku, or actually managing my own servers
- speedrun calculus more, but analysis less because I managed to make calc work for me in a way I never did with analysis. That being said, trying to complete the courses for a major in 2 years is honestly really fun and recommended
