The way I deal with it is mostly through a bunch of solitary hobbies: cooking, reading, languages, that sort of thing. Also going for an hour or so of walking a day at least seems to be ideal for me. Right now a lot of what I'm doing is just reading and writing a lot, Emacs is helping with the writing thing, I had no idea how much easier typing gets once you no longer have to reach for backspace except in extreme cases (usually you want either "transpose char/word", "replace-backwards string with string", and "jump-to; kill-between" and rebinding ctrl to caps makes that much faster than otherwise because you don't scrunch your hand or accidentally miss ctrl for super and it's just so so so customizable and I love every bit of that because it's way less crufty than even VS Code) and generally just getting comfycozy on Linux again, I had forgotten how much I disliked web browsers. 

I'm not quite sure what you mean by "coding" because programming no longer does nor does project euler/code kata type problems but just setting up exobrain type infra is so so so nice because it reduces the number of cache misses that my brain has (I actually dislike Discord because it forces me to either download a whole entire app or even use my web browser which sucks) (I uh, think that I might actually be ~OCD with regard to how I am about tech + programming + my computers but I just have v v low conscientiousness otherwise because generally if I have spoons I'm either building up scripts or reading or writing and not like, doing laundry or cooking) (wrt "I don't program anymore": I have written ~10 lines of code in the past week for work (excluding shit I've deleted) and ~10 lines for interviews). Nesting instinct isn't the right word it's just that I don't have to worry about code like I have to worry about people because people are so damn touchy and finicky that I need to constantly keep my senses open to try to learn them.
